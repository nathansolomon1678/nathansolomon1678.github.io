    "Instructions": "The sauce keeps well in the fridge, so you can prepare a ton at once. To prepare sauce, sauté onion in olive oil until it's just beginning to char. Then add flour and stir until smooth, and add everything else and cook until the tomatoes are soft. Once that's done, blend everything.<br><br>Bake or air-fry corn tortillas (around 15 minutes at 350°F). Cook refried beans and spread those on top. Fry eggs (with a bit of butter, and  with salt and pepper sprinkled on top). Pour sauce on top, then add sliced avocados and shredded cheddar cheese."
