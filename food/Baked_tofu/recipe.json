    },
    "Ingredients": [
        "Firm tofu",
        "Soy sauce",
        "Ground coriander",
        "Ginger",
        "Garlic",
        "Star anise",
        "Green onions (bias cut)",
        "Chili flakes (optional)",
        "Laoganma chili sauce (optional",
        "Miso paste (optional)"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Cut tofu into cubes and then marinate overnight with all the other ingredients. Take out the star anise and any large chunks of ginger, then throw in the oven around 350°F and stir occasionally until nicely cooked.",
    "Serving suggestion": "This goes great on top of rice, especially along with spinach, fried eggs, bean sprouts, and other side dishes like you'd put on bibimbap.",
    "Notes": "The reason this is baked instead of braised in a pan is because stirring tofu can cause it to crumble, which looks less appetizing than nice cubes of tofu"
