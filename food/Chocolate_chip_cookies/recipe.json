        "1/3 cup butter",
        "1/3 cup shortening",
        "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
        "1/2 cup brown sugar",
        "2 tsp vanilla extract",

    ],
    "Instructions": "Mix ingredients in the order they're listed above. Add as many walnuts and chocolate chips the dough can hold. Roll doough into balls, toss them on an insulated baking sheet (so they don't burn on the botton), and bake at 375Â°F for about 10 minutes, until done around the edges but still gooey in the middle."
