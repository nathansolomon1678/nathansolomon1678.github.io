<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>A bunch of Chinese broccoli (gai lan)</li>
<li>Vegetable oil</li>
<li>A lot of garlic</li>
<li>Oyster sauce</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Wash the Chinese broccoli and pat it dry with a towel, since moisture will cause the oil to splatter. Cut the leaves and florets off and set them aside, and cut the thick stems into large chunks. Heat up oil until you see Schlieren lines, then throw in in the stems and stir frequently while they cook for 5-10 minutes. Getting that cook time right is important, because you want the stems to be tender and soft as butter. Roughly chop up a lot of garlic and add that while the oil is still hot. Continue cooking and stirring constantly until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute, then add the leaves, florets, oyster sauce, and salt. Cook on high heat while stirring until the leaves have shrunk down and look done, about 3-5 minutes.</p>
