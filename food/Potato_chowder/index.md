# Potato chowder
## Ingredients
These are all very approximate:
* 4 large russet potatoes
* Half a large yellow onion
* Half pound frozen corn
* 2 cups milk
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 2 tbsp butter
* Water

## Instructions
Cut potatoes into cubes. Melt butter and cook onions in there. Add everything else. Add water until potatoes are covered. Cook. If you make this for multiple days, it'll get better each day as the potatoes soften and dissolve more.
Serve with toasted french bread.
