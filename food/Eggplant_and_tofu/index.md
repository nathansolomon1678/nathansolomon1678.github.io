# Eggplant & tofu

## Ingredients
* Eggplant
* Firm tofu
* Vegetable oil
* White vinegar
* Soy sauce
* Chili garlic sauce
* Garlic
* Szechuan peppercorns
* Sugar (optional)
* Cornstarch (optional)

## Cooking instructions
Cut eggplant and tofu into 1-inch cubes. Toss in everything else. Boil and stir until it has a nice consistency. Serve with sticky rice.

## Notes
If you add in cornstarch, remember to mix it with a liquid (probably soy sauce) first. Otherwise it will form lumps.
