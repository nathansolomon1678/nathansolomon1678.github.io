    ],
    "Instructions": "Mix all the ingredients. Squish into flat pancakes, about a half centimeter thick, using a rolling pin. Put enough vegetable oil in a frying pan to cover the surface, but not so much that there will be leftover oil when you're done cooking. Fry the pancakes on medium heat. Serve with jook (and of course, serve the jook with soy sauce, sesame oil, & ginger)."
