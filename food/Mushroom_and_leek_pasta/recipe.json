    "Ingredients": [
        "Pasta or gnocchi",
        "Brown mushrooms",
        "Leeks (or asparagus, but I prefer leeks)",
        "Butter or olive oil",
        "Miso paste or salt",
        "Black pepper",
        "Italian seasoning (the dried herb mix)",
        "Smoked paprika"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Boil the pasta/gnocchi until done (or leave it slightly undercooked -- maybe only boil for around 5 minutes?), then drain that. Saut√© the mushrooms and whatever other vegetables you want to throw in, then mix that with the pasta."
