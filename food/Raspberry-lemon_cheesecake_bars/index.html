<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> Makes a 9" by 13" dish of cheesecake</p>
            
            
<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>Another 2 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>6 tbsp butter</li>
<li>3 cups (12 ounces) raspberries (or any berries, really)</li>
<li>At least 2 tbsp lemon juice, plus some lemon zest if you feel like it</li>
<li>2 pounds cream cheese</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Line a 9" by 13" baking dish with aluminum foil. Mix graham cracker crumbs with the butter and the 2 tbsp sugar, then press that mixture into the baking dish and bake for 10 minutes at 325Â°F. Beat together the cream cheese, lemon juice (and zest), and sugar until smooth, then add the eggs and beat until mixture is smooth again. Mix in the berries, then toss that whole mixture over the crust, and bake at the same temperature for 3 to 40 minutes (until the cheesecake is set, and possibly cracking). Cool for a few hours before eating.</p>
