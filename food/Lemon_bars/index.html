<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Shortbread</h3>
<ul>
<li>7/4 cups flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
<li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 cup (2 sticks) butter (salted)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>6 eggs</li>
<li>Less than 2 cups sugar</li>
<li>1 cup lemon juice (I used meyer lemons)</li>
<li>2/3 cup flour</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Cover a 9"*13" baking dish in aluminum foil. Mix flour, cornstarch, powdered sugar, and chunks of butter. Then throw all that in a food processor (that will be messy) and put the processed stuff in the baking sheet. Press it down to form a uniformly thick crust, then refrigerate that for a while. Then bake it at 350°F until it's lightly goldened, about 20 minutes. For the filling, just whisk together the remaining ingredients, and try as hard as you can to destroy lumps of flour. When the crust is toasted, pour the filling in and bake at the same temperature (350°F) until it's firm, roughly 30 minutes. You'll know it's done once it looks done and when tilting the baking dish doesn't make the filling slosh around at all. Cool the lemon bars at room temperature once done, then them refrigerate until you're ready to eat them.</p>
            
<hr><h2>Serving suggestion</h2>
<p>You can use almost the same recipe to make grapefruit bars. Replace the lemon juice with grapefruit juice, use less sugar in the filling, and when it's almost done baking, sprinkle rosemary on top.</p>
