    "Instructions": "Mix flour, water, salt, and butter/oil to make tortilla dough, then knead it and let it rest for a while. Chop up a ton of mushrooms, a ton of garlic, and toss that in a pan along with all the other ingredients for the mushroom filling. Cook that mixture on low to medium heat until any moisture released from the mushrooms has evaporated off. Roll tortillas out very thin and fry them in oil on medium to high heat until they have brown spots. Add mushroom filling, guacamole, and other toppings, and eat the tacos while the tortillas are still hot."
