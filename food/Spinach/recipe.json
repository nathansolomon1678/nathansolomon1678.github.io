    "Serving size": "3 or 4 servings",
    "Ingredients": [
        "Spinach",
        "Vegetable oil",
        "Garlic",
        "Salt",
        "Mushroom powder or MSG",
        "Water"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Heat a tablespoon or so of oil (on high heat) until it's lost all viscosity and covers the bottom of the pot. Then add the garlic and stir, and immediately add the spinach stems right after, and stir so it doesn't burn. Also add a couple tablespoons of water (so it doesn't burn) and stir for another 30 seconds or so. Then add the spinach leaves and cover with a lid. Shake around for a few minutes while it's still cooking on high heat -- you don't want to take off the lid and let out the steam, because steaming is essential to getting the soft-but-also-crunchy texture. Once the leaves on top look wilted (ideally you're using a glass lid), open it up to make sure the leaves on the botton look fully cooked, and then flip so those are on top. Mix in salt and mushroom powder or MSG, then cook for another minute or so and leave the lid on afterwards so it can retain steam until the minute it's served."
