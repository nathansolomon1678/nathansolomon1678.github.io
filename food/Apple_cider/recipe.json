{
    "Ingredients": [
        "1 gallon of apple juice",
        "A large orange, sliced, with the peel still on",
        "One stick of cinnamon",
        "A teaspoon or so of cloves"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Toss everything in a pot and boil it.",
    "Serving suggestion": "Serve either hot or cold, or anywhere in between. Strain out the solid parts, but save the orange slices (including the peel) to be snacked on later.",
    "Notes": "Using blood oranges instead of oranges might seem like a cool idea, but that turns the cider bitter."
