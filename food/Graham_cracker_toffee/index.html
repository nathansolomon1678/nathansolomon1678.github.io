<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>13 graham crackers, or as many fit in a baking sheet</li>
<li>3/4 cups butter (3/2 sticks)</li>
<li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>About 3/2 cups chocolate chips</li>
<li>About 1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
<li>Coarse salt (like sea salt)</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Cover a baking pan with foil and line it with graham crackers, fitting as many as you can. In a small pot, melt butter, then add sugar and cook on fairly low heat until it's all mixed. Pour that caramel over the graham crackers and spread it around so the crackers are all covered, then toss it in an oven at 375Â°F (If you aren't using a convection oven, put an insulated baking sheet of something under the baking pan with the toffee, so that the caramel doesn't get burnt). Cook until the caramel is bubbling and dark but not yet burnt, around 6 minutes. Toss chocolate on top and put the toffee back in the oven for a minute or so, just enough to soften the chocolate. Take it out of the oven, spread the chocolate around, sprinkle on salt, and then sprinkle on nuts. Let it cool, then toss in the freezer for half an hour, then break it into pieces. To make this extra fancy, use more caramel, dark chocolate instead of normal chocolate, and almonds instead of walnuts.</p>
