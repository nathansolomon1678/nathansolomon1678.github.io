    "Ingredients": [
        "13 graham crackers, or as many fit in a baking sheet",
        "3/4 cups butter (3/2 sticks)",
        "1/2 cup brown sugar",
        "About 3/2 cups chocolate chips",
        "About 1 cup chopped walnuts or almonds",
        "Coarse salt (like sea salt)"
    ],
    "Instructions":
        "Cover a baking pan with foil and line it with graham crackers, fitting as many as you can. In a small pot, melt butter, then add sugar and cook on fairly low heat until it's all mixed. Pour that caramel over the graham crackers, spread it around so the crackers are all covered, and then toss in an oven at 375Â°F. Cook until the caramel is bubbling and dark but not yet burnt, around 10 minutes. Toss chocolate on top and put back in the over for a minute or so, just enough to soften the chocolate. Take it out of the oven, spread the chocolate around, sprinkle on salt, and then sprinkle on nuts. Let it cool, then toss in the freezer for half an hour, then break it into pieces."
