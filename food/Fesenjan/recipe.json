    ],
    "Instructions": "Toast walnuts so they aren't bitter, then blend them into a slightly coarse paste. Caramelize onion in olive oil, then add garlic, spices, and orange zest and cook for a while longer. Add the pomegranate syrup and the walnut paste, then simmer on low heat until done. Use very little turmeric, since that will turn it from nice purple to ugle yellow-green-brown.",
