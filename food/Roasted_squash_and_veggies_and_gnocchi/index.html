<p><i>Served with basil garnish and a side of bread</i></p>
            
<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Butternut squash (cubed, with or without peel)</li>
<li>Brussel sprouts (halved)</li>
<li>Leeks (thoroughly cleaned and sliced)</li>
<li>Rainbow carrots</li>
<li>Garlic (whole, crushed, peeled cloves)</li>
<li>Onion</li>
<li>Olive oil (enough to coat everything)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Chili powder</li>
<li>Smoked paprika</li>
<li>Italian seasoning</li>
<li>Gnocchi</li>
<li>Red bell pepper</li>
<li>Fresh thyme (or just use more dry Italian seasoning)</li>
<li>Basil</li>
<li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Mix everything except the last 5 ingredients in a baking sheet, then stir until everything has olive oil on it. Bake at 400 Fahrenheit for around half an hour, then take it out, stir again, and mix in the gnocchi & bell pepper. Bake for another 45 minutes or so, and stir once or twice during that time. Take it out of the oven once all the vegetables are soft and starting to char, and the gnocchi is getting crisp. The last (or second-to-last) time you take the vegetables out of the oven to stir, they should be sticking to the bottom of the baking pan, indicating that the vegetables are nicely browned and caramelized. After taking it out, mix in the chopped basil.</p>
            
<hr><h2>Serving suggestion</h2>
<p>Add extra basil on top as a garnish. Right before eating, splash in a bit of balsamic vinegar. Do not add in the vinegar any earlier or it will "digest" your food.</p>
            
<hr><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Lots of these ingredients have the same season. Ideally make this dish around October.</p>
