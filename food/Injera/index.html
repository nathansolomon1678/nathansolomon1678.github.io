<p><strong>Serving size:</strong> Roughly 3 10"-diameter pancakes</p>
            
            
<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 cup teff flour</li>
<li>1 cup wheat or teff flour</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>Injera starter (optional)</li>
<li>A tiny bit of salt (optional)</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Mix flour, water, and starter. Leave that to ferment for around 2 days (or a bit longer if you want it more sour, or if you didn't use a starter, or if it's cold out). When you cover it, make sure to allow air in and out to prevent toxic anaerobic bacteria from growing. After fermenting, pour out the clear watery layer at the top, and use roughly that same amount of water for preparing the absit (a gelatinized portion of the batter that will help hold air and liquid in the batter as it cooks). Also, set aside some of the batter to use as a starter for the next time you make injera. To make the absit, bring that water to a boil, and toss in a small amount of your batter. Continue cooking it while stirring constantly until it becomes a thick, even mixture. Let the absit cool, then mix it back into the batter, along with a bit of salt. Let the batter ferment a bit more (but no more than a day) and then cook it like a pancake or crÃªpe in a nonstick pan. The injera is done when the edges are just beginning to curl upwrds. After taking the injera out of the pan, do not stack it, since that would make it continue cooking.</p>
