    "Ingredients": [
        "White rice",
        "Vegetable oil",
        "Sesame oil",
        "Onion",
        "Carrots",
        "Eggs",
        "Frozen peas",
        "Lots of Laoganma chili oil (or gochujang)",
        "Soy sauce",
        "Oyster sauce"
    ],
    "Instructions": "A day or so in advance, cook some rice and leave it in the fridge until you're about to cook everything else. This will make it drier than freshly cooked rice, which results in a much better texture.<br><br>Dice the onion and carrots. Toss vegetable oil into a large skillet and turn the heat to high. Once the oil is very hot, throw in the onion and carrots, then cook those (still at high heat) until they have softened, and add a bit of sesame oil. Move the vegetables to the side of the skillet and crack an egg or two on the other side and stir immediately. You want to mix the egg with the rest of your fried rice as little as possible, because if the grains of rice get coated in raw egg your whole dish will become a soggy mush.<br><br>Once the eggs are cooked, you can toss in everything else. Continue cooking until the rice has a nice texture and the peas taste like they're cooked through.",
    "Serving suggestion": "Eat as soon as it is done cooking, while the fried rice is still hot and aromatic.",
    "Notes": "The proportions for this dish are not at all precise, but some of the cooking methods are. Don't be afraid to use a decent bit of oil, since that will prevent the rice from clumping. Most importantly, you should stir frequently and you should not overcrowd the pan, because if the rice piles up in one place for too long, it will steam itself and get mushy. To make multiple servings worth of fried rice at once, consider cooking in batches or using two pans."
