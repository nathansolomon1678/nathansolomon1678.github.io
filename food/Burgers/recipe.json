    "Ingredients": [
        "Beyond burgers (or Impossible burgers or whatever -- I like Beyond burgers though)",
        "Cremini mushrooms, sauteed with a tiny bit of butter (and maybe parsley?)",
        "Swiss cheese",
        "Burger buns, lightly toasted"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Thaw patties in a microwave (assuming you buy them frozen), then cook them on one side for around 5 minutes, flip and throw cheese on top, and cook for another 5 minutes or so. Slap that on your bun with any other condiments and eat while still hot."
