<p><i>Cooking this in a shallow pan was not a smart move, since spinach is very voluminous before cooking, and because oil can splatter onto the flame.</i></p>
            
<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Laoganma chili oil</li>
<li>Several cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
<li>Ground peppercorns</li>
<li>Bean sprouts</li>
<li>Spinach</li>
<li>A little bit of oyster sauce</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Briefly cook garlic and pepper in the chili oil, then add the bean sprouts and stir until they are evenly coated in the chili oil and garlic. Next, add the spinach, oyster sauce, and salt, and stir continuously until the spinach is soft (around 3 minutes).</p>
            
<hr><h2>Serving suggestion</h2>
<p>There will probably be some liquidy sauce at the bottom of your pan when your done, so serve this dish with rice to soak up that sauce.</p>
            
<hr><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>In order for the bean sprouts to have the right texture, they need to be cooked quickly at high heat. Right before adding the bean sprout (and maybe also before adding the garlic), get the oil as hot as you can without burning the chili oil.</p>
