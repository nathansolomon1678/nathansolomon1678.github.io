    "Ingredients": [
        "King oyster mushrooms",
        "Vegetable oil",
        "Garlic",
        "Water spinach (\"hollow-heart vegetable\")",
        "Salt"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Cut mushrooms against the grain into bite-sized pieces, then sear those. That will prevent the mushrooms from getting rubbery. Add in the oil and garlic and cook until fragrant, then add in the water-spinach stems and cook until they start to soften. Add the leaves and cook until they're done, then add salt."
