        "Potatoes",
        "Turnips",
        "Parsnips",
        "Rutabagas",
        "Olive oil",
        "Rosemary or other herbs",
        "Salt",
        "Lots of roughly chopped garlic",
        "Black pepper"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Put in baking sheet and toss until coated in olive oil. If you don't use enough olive oil, the veggies will get a dull color and dry-tough texture, but if you add too much, they will absorb the oil and get soggy -- to get dark, crisp vegetables, use just enough oil to thinly coat them. Bake around 450Ffor a long time, until cubed root vegetables start getting crisp shells and have significantly darkened.",
    "Notes": "You can add pretty much any vegetable to this, such as carrots and squash. One of my favorite variations uses only brussel sprouts, canned garbanzo beans, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and a bit of lemon juice."
