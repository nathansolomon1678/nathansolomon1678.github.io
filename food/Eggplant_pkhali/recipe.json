    "Ingredients": [
        "2 eggplants",
        "A few handfuls of walnuts",
        "A splash of wine vinegar, or a few drops of balsamic vinegar",
        "A few cloves garlic",
        "Salt",
        "Ground black pepper",
        "Cilantro leaves",
        "Pomegranate seeds"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Roast eggplants at 375F until they are soft and the pulp separates easily from the skin. Scrape out the pulp and discard the skin. In a food processor, blend the walnuts until they are completely mushy and smooth. Add the vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper, and continue blending until it is once again smooth. Some people might also add olive oil, ground coriander, fenugreek, onions, summer savory, or other herbs, but you don't really need those. Sprinkle cilantro leaves and pomegranate seeds on top.",
    "Serving suggestion": "This goes really well with pita chips.",
    "Notes": "You can make pkhali with other vegetables besides eggplant, although the eggplant version is my favorite. For beet pkhali, use cooked red beets instead of eggplant, and for spinach pkhali, use fresh spinach instead of eggplant. You can also make lobio by soaking kidney beans overnight and then cooking them until they're soft, then using that in place of eggplant."
