<p><i>Above: A double recipe (two loaves) of bread with garlic powder and fresh rosemary</i></p>
            
<hr><h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>7/2 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour</li>
<li>One packet (or 2 tsp) active yeast</li>
<li>2 tsp salt</li>
<li>3/2 cups water</li>
<li>Grease (shortening)</li>
<li>Optional add-ins: 1 tsp garlic powder, leaves from a few sprigs of rosemary</li>
</ul>
            
<hr><h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Dissolve salt and yeast (and any add-ins) in water. Gradually add flour and knead it a bunch, so that it becomes chewier. Let it rise in a warm place until it's sufficiently poofy -- it should roughly double in size. Grease a baking sheet. Shape the bread and place it on the baking sheet, let it rise a final time in the oven, and then bake it on the bottom shelf of the oven until it sounds hollow. The cooking time is around 20 minutes and the temperature is around 450 Fahrenheit, but that will depend on the thickness of the bread and whether you preheat the oven.</p>
