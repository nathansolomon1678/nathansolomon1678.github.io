    "Ingredients": [
        "Polenta (water or milk, corn meal, and a bit of parmesan cheese)",
        "Carrots or parsnips",
        "A good amount of butter",
        "Miso paste",
        "Thyme",
        "Black pepper (optional)",
        "Smoked paprika (optional)"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Cook corn meal with plenty of water and for plenty of time while stirring frequently, so that it becomes soft and silky, then mix in a bit of parmesan cheese before it cools. If your polenta is grainy and lumpy, just add more water and cook it more (while stirring). Meanwhile, cut carrots in half lengthwise, and throw them in a pot with the butter, miso paste, and thyme. Also add black pepper and smoked paprika. Cook on moderately high heat for a while, until they are soft. As the carrots cook, you may need to add water to deglaze the pot.",
    "Notes": "Lots of other vegetables are great served over polenta, such as (1) leeks cooked this exact same way, (2) mushroom bourguignon, or (3) charred broccolini with garlic and lemon and coarsely ground black pepper."
