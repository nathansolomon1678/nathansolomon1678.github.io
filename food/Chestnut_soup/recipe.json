    "Ingredients": [
        "Cooked and peeled chestnuts",
        "Olive oil or butter",
        "Shallots",
        "Carrots",
        "Celery (optional)",
        "Garlic",
        "Thyme",
        "Bay leaves",
        "Salt",
        "White or black pepper",
        "Heavy cream or crème fraiche",
        "Ground nutmeg",
        "Green onions",
        "Crisply fried oyster mushrooms, or bacon"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Get chestnuts that are already roasted/boiled and peeled, because peeling them yourself is a pain. Chop the shallots, carrots, celery, and garlic, then fry those in olive oil or butter until soft and aromatic. Then add the chestnuts, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Boil until everything in the pot except the bay leaves are soft, then take out the bay leaves. Purée the soup with an immersion blender, then add the cream and boil briefly, until it tastes done. Stir in a bit of nutmeg, then garnish with crème fraiche, green onions, and either crumbled bacon or crisped oyster mushrooms. To make the bacon-like oyster mushrooms, marinate oyster mushrooms in soy sauce, smoked paprika, black pepper, salt, maple syrup, and olive oil, then cut them into strips and fry them.",
    "Serving suggestion": "Serve hot, and keep in mind that it will thicken as it cools (so err on the side of making it thinner).",
    "Notes": "This soup is supposed to be rich and creamy, with a smooth texture and a warm brown color. To get the right texture and color, you need to use enough cream, blend it until it's totally smooth, and use plenty of carrots. If you're worried about getting the right texture, leave out the celery, and add a tiny bit of bright red paprika.<br><br>The techniques, ingrediesnt, and garnishes for this soup can be applied to tons of other soups, such as pumpkin soup, or potato and leek soup."
