    "Ingredients": [
        "2 cups flour",
        "1/4 cup sugar",
        "5/4 tsp baking powder",
        "1/4 tsp baking soda",
        "1/2 cup (1 stick) butter",
        "1 cup chocolate chips, berries, or other add-ins",
        "3/4 cup buttermilk",
        "2 tsp vanilla extract"
    ],
    "Instructions": "Preheat oven to 400F. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Cut the butter into thin strips or cubes, then cut that into the dry ingredients until the largest chunks of butter are the size of a pea. Mix the buttermilk and vanilla, then pour that into the bowl. Also add your add-ins at this point. I recommend using either (1) mini chocolate chips, (2) orange zest and dried cranberries, or (3) small chunks of fresh fruit, like blueberries or raspberries. Stir with a spoon until the batter is mostly homogeneous, then scoop it onto an ungreased baking dish. If you want to make them look a fancier, shape all of your dough into a disc and then cut it into wedges -- this makes it look a lot nicer, but is annoying to do because the dough will be very sticky. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden. Let them cool a bit, but eat while still warm.",
    "Notes": "The hardest part about making scones is that you cannot mix them too much. If the gluten develops too much, it will become dense, so you want to stir and knead the dough as little as possible. Also, you want small chunks of butter in your dough, because when the scones bake, those pieces will become pockets of grease and steam, contributing to the soft, fluffy, and layered texture of the finished product."
