# Bread
> Credit: [https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-artisan-bread/](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-artisan-bread/)

## Serving size
Makes one loaf

## Ingredients
* 3+1/4 cups flour (or bread flour)
* One packet yeast
* 2 tsp salt
* 1+1/2 cups water
* Rosemary or other savory add-ins (optional)
* Cornmeal (optional)

## Instructions
Dissolve salt and yeast (and add-ins?) in water. Gradually add flour and knead it a bunch, so that it becomes chewier. Let it rise in a warm place until it's sufficiently poofy -- it should roughly double in size. If you're using cornmeal, sprinkle it on a baking sheet. Shape the bread and place it on the baking sheet, let it rise a final time in the oven, and then bake it. The cooking time is around 25 minutes and the temperature is around 450 Fahrenheit, but that will depend on the thickness of the bread.
