# Finnish pancake
## Ingredients
* 3 eggs (separated)
* 2 cups milk
* 1 tablespoon honey or sugar
* 3/4 cup flour
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 4 tbsp butter
* 3/8 tsp cream of tartar

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 450F. Beat yolks with milk and stir in honey/sugar, flour, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff, then fold that into the first bowl. In a large frying pan, melt and spread around butter, then pour in the batter. Bake for 25 minutes (or if you're doing a double recipe, cook for 40 minutes at a cooler temperature). Be careful to not let it burn at the top, and don't open the oven until it's done (or it will deflate). Serve with berries or berry jam.
